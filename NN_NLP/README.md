For the final project, I did 'Poem Generation' and I got the dataset from Kaggle.
The dataset basically has two sections: forms and topics.
Under the section topics, I chose ballads for training the data.
Basically, we fine-tune a pretrained transformer model from the transformers library by HuggingFace. 
It is done using with FastAI's data loaders. 
In this project, we experiment with GPT2.
